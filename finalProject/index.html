                <h4>Maria C.</h4>
                <p>Stayed at our Oakland location</p>
                <p>"When I was planning the trip, I'll be honest, I wasn't sure if I would feel comfortable staying in oakland for a couple of days. Fortunately, that all changed when I saw the location of the Temple Inn and  Suites. It was very close to the temple and felt like such an inviting and secure place. I would highly suggest anyone looking for a place to stay for the temple trip check out the Temple Inn and Suites. They will have my patronage from now on."</p>

                <h4>Porter R.</h4>
                <p>Stayed at our Winter Quarters location</p>
                <p>"I am in love with church history, but constant travel isn't very realistic for me financially. So when I found out that there was an affordable place to stay themed around the area of Winter Quarters I thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to visit and enjoy the history there. I was not dissapointed upon arrival. In the lobby there were all sorts of cool facts about the early church on display there and I was able to meet others who were just as excided about all this as I was. Highly reccomended to anyone."
